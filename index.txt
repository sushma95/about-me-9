Vigneshwar Reddy Lenkala - Section 03 - Dr. Eloe

I am a new member of the Spring Batch 2020 working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science.

I am from Nalgonda, Telangana, India. I completed my bachelors in Vignana Bharathi Institute of technology,Hyderabad in the year 2019 . My major was in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My hobbies are watching movies and playing video games. Whenever i get bored I  travel to hill stations or greenery places with my father because travelling with my dad makes me learn new things every time .

My current goal is to become a full-stack developer. I hope Master's education would enhance my skill set further and help me build a fruitful career.
